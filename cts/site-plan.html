      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I’m making an informative website for curly hair. My website will show the different curl types and have overviews of porosity levels to help people learn more about what products are best for their hair type. I will review most popular products and have categories for affordable and expensive products comparing the two. I will also have steps for how the products should be used to help people transitioning into wearing their curls naturally learn routines made for their hair type. For those of you who have had bad hair days or frustrating moments with your curly hair. Did you know that the products you bought would work for your hair? Did it weigh your hair down? Did it contain healthy ingredients to nourish and strengthen your hair? That’s what I do for you. I will make a website to take away those frustrations and help your curls get the love that they need. All the searching for the right products and testing out some that just don’t work will come to an end. 
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone with type 3A, 3B, 3C, 4A, 4B, or 4C hair. This includes those with curly or coily hair types. It applies to both men and women, but I am targetting more of a female audience. It will be helpful for those with short, medium, or long hair. My website is informational, so it applies to any age. It can help mothers who do not know how to style their children's curlier hair texture. Young girls or boys who need help learning how to style their hair and embrace it more. Older women who finally want to stop straightening their hair and go natural.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to my site seeking for information about different curl types, how to properly style their hair, and products for their specific hair type. I will teach visitors more about what their hair needs. Visitors will also learn more about porosity levels in their hair. This will help them determine if their hair needs more hydration or protein. If a visitor has type 3c hair, then I will show them what products work best for their hair and how to use those products. I will also have the best affordable and expensive options to help everyone who come from different backgrounds and have different needs. My home page will contain an overview of information about porosity levels and the different hair types. After my visitors learn what their hair type is they can then navigate to the page regarding their hair type. My two pages will be focused on type 3 hair and type 4 hair because those hair types are considered to be curly hair. Type 1 is straight hair and type 2 is wavy hair. My visitors will prefer my site over others because it has condensed a lot of valuable information all in one. It is also not biased because I am not promoting certain curly hair product companies. My review of these products will be based on my experiences and the experiences of others that I will thoroughly research. 
      </p>
      <h3>Hair Porosity</h3>
      <p>Porosity is how well your hair is able to hold moisture. Knowing your porosity levels will help you know which products are best for your hair and keep your hair from getting frizzy. There are three types of porosity: low, medium (or normal), and high. Normal porosity means that your hair has a good balance and is usually just fine on its own. Low porosity means that your cuticles are closed shut, not allowing moisture to come into your hair strands. How to know if you have low porosity? Your hair doesn't soak up products too well, so you may have product buildup or the product just sits on your hair. Your hair doesn't take hair color too easily. Your hair is very dry and takes a long time to get wet. Once your hair is wet, it takes a long time to dry. Thicker products leaves your hair greasy. Low porosity hair is protein sensitive. It is suggested to use fewer products on low porosity hair when styling because too much product might weigh the hair down. So one product can work just fine! How to know if you have high porosity hair? Your cuticle is really open so it easily absorbs moisture, but it has a hard time retaining that moisture. High porosity hair tends to be damaged or processed hair. It gets tangled very easily. It dries very fast. It tends to get frizzy often. High porosity needs more protein. Product wise, you'll want to use at least two or three products on your hair and style it soaking wet to really retain the moisture. It is also suggested to let your hair air dry because it dries so fast. </p>
      <h3>Hair Types</h3>
      <p>Straight hair is type 1 hair. Wavy hair is type 2. There is some movement to it but it is still quite similar to type 1. Curly hair is type 3. Type 3 is split is three parts 3a, 3b, and 3c. The curl strands range from loose and elongated to tight and shrunken. Coily hair is type 4. This type is typically extremely tight and thick. It is identified a type 4a, 4b, and 4c. It can range from tiny curl strands to more of a zig zag strand. All of these hair types give people a good idea of what cateogory their hair belongs in; however, every set of hair is so different and can have multiple hair types in one. Some people can be in between 3c/4a or 3a/3b. Some people can even have different hair types in certain parts of their hair!</p>
