            <h2>Hair Porosity</h3>
            <p>Porosity is how well your hair is able to hold moisture. Knowing your porosity levels will help you know which products are best for your hair and keep your hair from getting frizzy. There are three types of porosity: low, medium (or normal), and high. Normal porosity means that your hair has a good balance and is usually just fine on its own.</p>
            <h3>Low Porosity</h3>
            <p>Low porosity means that your cuticles are closed shut, not allowing moisture to come into your hair strands. How to know if you have low porosity? Your hair doesn't soak up products too well, so you may have product buildup or the product just sits on your hair. Your hair doesn't take hair color too easily. Your hair is very dry and takes a long time to get wet. Once your hair is wet, it takes a long time to dry. Thicker products leaves your hair greasy. Low porosity hair is protein sensitive. It is suggested to use fewer products on low porosity hair when styling because too much product might weigh the hair down. So one product can work just fine!</p>
            <h3>High Porosity</h3>
            <p>How to know if you have high porosity hair? High porosity hair means that your cuticle is really open so it easily absorbs moisture, but it has a hard time retaining that moisture. High porosity hair tends to be damaged or processed hair. It gets tangled very easily. It dries very fast. It tends to get frizzy often. High porosity needs more protein. Product wise, you'll want to use at least two or three products on your hair and style it soaking wet to really retain the moisture. It is also suggested to let your hair air dry because it dries so fast.</p>

            <h3>Hair Types</h3>
            <p>Straight hair is type 1 hair. Wavy hair is type 2. There is some movement to it but it is still quite similar to type 1. Curly hair is type 3. Type 3 is split is three parts 3a, 3b, and 3c. The curl strands range from loose and elongated to tight and shrunken. Coily hair is type 4. This type is typically extremely tight and thick. It is identified a type 4a, 4b, and 4c. It can range from tiny curl strands to more of a zig zag strand. All of these hair types give people a good idea of what cateogory their hair belongs in; however, every set of hair is so different and can have multiple hair types in one. Some people can be in between 3c/4a or 3a/3b. Some people can even have different hair types in certain parts of their hair!</p>
